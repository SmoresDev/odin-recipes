    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices bacon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>4 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup bottled clam juice</li>
        <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>6 ounces minced clams</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream (<i>optional</i>)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> In a large saucepan over medium high heat, fry the bacon until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels, reserving the bacon fat in the pan, crumble and set aside. </li>
        <li> In the same saucepan with the bacon fat, saute the onion and potatoes for 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with the flour and stir well to coat. </li>
        <li> Pour in the clam juice, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. </li>
        <li> Add the half-and-half and minced clams and season with salt and pepper to taste. Finally, whisk in the heavy cream, if desired. Allow to heat through, about 5 minutes. Garnish with the parsley and crumbled bacon. (Note: Do not boil if adding cream.)</li>
    </ol>
